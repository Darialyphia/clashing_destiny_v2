## Turn structure

At the start of a turn, both players draw 2 cards, then recollect all cards in their Destiny zone (see below) to their hand.

During a turn, players alternate taking action. On the first turn, Player 1 starts with the initiative and is able to play the first card. On the following turns, the first player who passed on the previous starts the turn with initiative.

The actions available are:

- Play a card from their hand
- Play a card from their Destiny Deck (see below)
- Declare an attack
- Use a card ability
- Pass

The player who can performe an action is called the **initiative player**. On the first turn, player 1 gets the initiative first. After that it goes back and forth between the two players.

## Actions

### Play a Card from hand

In order to play a card, players must put card from their hand face down into their Destiny Zone equal to the card's cost.
Playing any card starts an Card Chain (see below).

### Play a Card from Destiny deck

Each player has a Destiny Deck with 12 unique cards (the content of which is unknown to the opponent). Once per turn, A player may pay a card from their Destiny deck by banishing cards at random from their Destiny Zone equal to its cost.
As with playing cards from hand, playing a card from the Destiny Deck starts a Card Chain

### Declare an attack

A player may declare an attack with one of their minions of their hero. To do so, they declare its target (more info in the combat sectiob below).
Declaring an attack starts a Card Chain with the opponent having priority.

### Use a card ability

A player may use one of their card's ability. Abilities may be activated from different locations depending on the card (from hand, from the board, from the graveyard, etc).
Using a ability starts a Card Chain with the opponent having priority.

### Pass

Passing makes the opponent the initiative player. If both players pass in a row. The turn ends.
Once a player have passed, they will no longer get initiative this turn. They can, however, still react to their opponent's plays (by add cards to card chains, declaring a retaliation, etc...)

## Cards

### Playing restriction

In order to be played, a card needs to match the class ans spell shcools of your Hero (see below).
The also need to match your deck's chosen **spell School**.

### Spell Schools

There are 7 spell schools in the game: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, Dark and Arcane. When building a deck, you choose up to 2 spell schools, and can only play cards that match one of these spell schools (or that don't have any spell school requirements).

### Card Source

There are 2 kinds of cards: Main deck cards, and Destiny Deck Cards. This defines which deck they go to, and thus how they are played.

### Card Speed

Every card has a _Speed_ stat:

- Slow: this card cannot be played during an ongoing Card chain and can only be played when its owner is the initiative player.
- Fast: this card can be played during a Card Chain, or to start one. It can be played even if its owner is not the initiative player.
- Flash: this card can be played at the same time a Fast card can be played. However, it will not go into the Card Chain and will resolve instantly. Furthermore, playing an Instant speed card does not pass card chain priority, nor switch the initiative player.

### Card Chain

Card Chains are the mechanism used to resolve multiple card that happen at the same time. Priority alternates between players during a card chain. When they have priority, a player can

- pass
- add another effect to the chain. This can done by :
  - playing a card from their hand
  - playing a card from their Destiny Deck
  - using a card ability
  - choosing to retaliate. This can only happen when one of your unit is getting attacked.

Once both players have successively passed, the chains resolves in a FILO (First In, Last Out) manner, until the chain is empty.

Note that the priority is independant from the initiative player : if player 1 is the initiative player, but player 2 is the last player to add a card to the chain, once the chain resolves, player 2 still becomes the initiative player.

Example:

- player 1 plays **Fireball**, targeting the opponent's hero, trying to deal damage
- player 2 adds **Holy Barrier** to the chain, trying to mitigate all damage their heero takes this turn
- player 1 adds **Unrelenting Destruction**, which negates all effects that prevent damage this turn
- player 2 passes
- player 1 passes
  The chain now resolves backwards
- **Unrelenting Destruction** resolves, preventing damage negation
- **Holy Barrier** resolves, however, because of **Unrelenting Destruction**, its effect is negated and does nothing
- **Fireball** resolves, dealing damage to the opponent's hero

#### Exhaustion

An exhausted card cannot attack, retaliate, or use an ability. A card becomes exhausted when it declares an attacks, retaliates, or uses an ability (note: not all abilities exhaust the card).
A card loses its exhausted status at the start of the turn. Taking damage from an attack does not exhaust if you choose not to retaliate.

Losing the exhausted status is referred as waking up the card.

### Hero

The hero card is the most important card in a deck. If its HP are reduced to 0, its owner loses the game.
Heroes have the following stats:

- HP
- Attack
- Level
- Class

Player start the game with a fixed lvl 0 hero on the board.

Heroes are always Destiny Deck cards. To play a hero of level greater than 1, a player's current hero must meet the following requirements:

- have exactly one level less than the hero (a lvl 2 hero can only be played over a lvl 1 hero)
- share the same **lineage**. For example, "Erina, Aether Scholar", can only be lpayed over a level 1 "Erina" hero.

When a hero levels up, it keeps the ongoing effects

### Minions

Each player has 2 columns of 4 slots each: the front line and the back line. A minion can usually be player on any slot of any column, even though specific restrictions may apply.
Minions remain on the board until their HP is reduced to 0.

### Spells

Spells are one time effects. Once resolved, they go directly to the discard pile.

### Artifacts

Artifacts are attached to your Hero and enhance their performance in battle or give them new abilities. Every Artifact has a durability stat; when it reaches 0, the artifact is removed and sent to the discard pile. In most cases, using an artifact's ability will consume one or more durability.

A hero can only have 3 artifacts equiped at the same time. If they try to play a fourth one, they must choose one of their already equiped artifacts to destroy.

### Sigils

Sigils are played on your front row or back row, like minions. However, they cannot attack or retaliate. They just take space on the board.Sigils have a Countsown start. At the start of each turn, this countdown decreases by 1. When it raches zero, the Sigil is destroyed and sent to the Discard pile.

## Combat

A combat occurs between 2 participants which can be a hero or a minion. A unit with 0 attack cannot declare an attack.

During combat:

- A Card chain is created, with the defending player having priority
- The defender may choose to retaliate or not. If it does, exhaust the card.
- Once the chain is resolved, combat occurs
- The attacker and defender (if they chose to retaliate) deal damage to each other at the same time, reducing each other's HP by their Attack value.
- once resolved, the game goes back to the Main Phase and the iniative player is switched.

### Targeting restriction

Under normal circumstances, a minion may only attack a minion in the same column as them. In addition, if the enemy column has a minion in both the front row and back row, they may only attack the one in the front row.
If there no enemy minion in a row,a minion may attack the enemy hero directly.
A hero can attack anywhere (any other enemy minion or hero)
