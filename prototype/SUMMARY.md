- Players alternate playing cards from their hand, one at a time, starting with the player who has the initiative (alternates each turn)
- To play a card, players place that many cards from their hand face-down as resources.
- Minions are placed in a single row; positioning is important.
- Minions have 3 stats: attack, health, and speed.
- After both players pass, combat begins automatically.
- During combat, minions automatically fight from right to left, one pair at a time.
- The minion with the higher Speed strikes first: If a minion dies before it can retaliate, it does not deal damage back.
- If both have equal Speed, minion deal damage at the same time.
- When a minion dies, the one to its left takes its place; When a player has no minions, their hero fights instead.
- Combat continues until there are no minions on the board, then a new turn begins
- The game ends when a hero reaches 0 HP.
